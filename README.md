# neoSaris - ICPC Standings Resolver

![Example image of neoSaris](public/scoreboard.jpg)

The code of this repository contains a react app that can be used to simulate what happens in the frozen time during a competitive programming competition with the ICPC standard rules.

Its UI is inspired by the [ICPC Resolver](https://tools.icpc.global/resolver/).
The name `neoSaris` is inspired by the original [S4RiS](https://github.com/OStrekalovsky/S4RiS-StanD), which development has been stopped since 2014. This neo version of S4RiS, is built from scratch and does not share any code with the original project.

This repository, is a hard-fork of the original (and abandoned) [SarisByAlgoritmiaESCOM](https://github.com/galloska/SarisByClubAlgoritmiaESCOM) created by [galloska](https://github.com/galloska), we decided to improve this project by refactoring major pieces, and integrating it with external platforms to be easier to use.

## How to Use

This tool is available on **[neosaris.huronos.org](https://neosaris.huronos.org)** thanks to the [huronOS project](https://huronos.org) who is providing the hosting.
You can either use it online as a web client, or you can install it locally following the [installation](#Installation) steps.

### Commands

**(N)ext Submission** `(press: n)`  
**1st** `n`, the UI goes to the next pending submission from bottom to top, and highlight it to let the user know that is the next pending submission to reveal.  
**2nd** `n`reveals the selected pending submission.

**(U)nfroze Standings** `(press: u)`  
Reveals the final standings.

**(T)op 10 Standings** `(press: t)`  
Reveals standing until the top 10. That means the top 10 will be in the frozen stage and then you can go one by one revealing the results.

## Why a [another] ICPC Resolver?

The current solutions like the official _ICPC Resolver_, require a lot of setup to make them work, other ones like the original S4RiS are abandoned. Added to this, any of them have integrations that allows them to be easier to use with popular platforms like _Codeforces_ which are commonly used to held official competitions, or annual contests.

The main purpose of **neoSaris** is to facilitate the access to a resolver without requiring to install a lot of stuff or the need to parse a lot of data to be used. That's why neoSaris is mounted on web which can be accessed by anyone at anytime, and just by filling some form data, they're ready to unfreeze their standings.

## Online Judges Integrations

Currently, neoSaris uses a data format described on the following subsection. But it have some integrations with:

- Codeforces
- vJudge

So that neoSaris automatically parses that data (from API or another data syntax) to the required neoSaris JSON input format.

### neoSaris JSON

The resolver needs a JSON input format that follows [this](https://github.com/equetzal/neoSaris/blob/main/src/types/contestDataTypes.ts) object model, and here is an [example](https://github.com/equetzal/SarisResolver/tree/public/example.json) of a valid object in JSON notation:

```json
{
  "contestMetadata": {
    "duration": 300,
    "frozenTimeDuration": 60,
    "name": "Trial Contest",
    "type": "ICPC"
  },
  "problems": [
    { "index": "A" },
    { "index": "B" },
    { "index": "C" },
    { "index": "D" },
    { "index": "E" },
    { "index": "F" },
    { "index": "G" },
    { "index": "H" },
    { "index": "I" },
    { "index": "J" }
  ],
  "contestants": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Red Panda" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Moscow IPT 1" },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Moscow IPT Jinotega" }
  ],
  "verdicts": {
    "accepted": ["Accepted"],
    "wrongAnswerWithPenalty": ["Wrong answer"],
    "wrongAnswerWithoutPenalty": ["Compilation error"]
  },
  "submissions": [
    {
      "timeSubmitted": 47,
      "contestantName": "Moscow IPT Jinotega",
      "problemIndex": "A",
      "verdict": "Accepted"
    },
    {
      "timeSubmitted": 260,
      "contestantName": "Moscow IPT 1",
      "problemIndex": "H",
      "verdict": "Wrong answer"
    },
    {
      "timeSubmitted": 270,
      "contestantName": "Moscow IPT 1",
      "problemIndex": "A",
      "verdict": "Accepted"
    }
  ]
}
```

**contestMetadata:** The `contestMetadata` contains information about the competition such as duration, frozen time and the name of the contest.

**problems:** The `problems` section describes all the important information about the problems, mainly its index letter, and optionally its name.

**contestants:** In the `contestants` part the id is the identifier of the contestant and it is followed by the name of the contestant.

<!-- and if you want show an image related with that team, you can copy the image to [src/university_logos](https://github.com/galloska/SarisByClubAlgoritmiaESCOM/tree/master/src/university_logos) and rename it to `key.png` where 'key' is the key value in the JSON file for that team.
-->

**verdicts:** This section will allow you to specify the verdicts of you _Online Judge_ and specify which submissions will be considered _Accepted_, _WrongAnswer_ or _WrongAnswerWithoutPenalty_.

**submissions:** An array containing the submissions of the contest. Each submission must have the time submission in minutes, the contestant that submitted the solution, the problem that was submitted and the verdict.

### Codeforces

Currently, neoSaris is integrated with the [Codeforces API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp). This integration will let you access the contests API and parse its responses to the Saris format, allowing you to unfreeze the standing automatically.

#### Public Contests

For unfreezing public contests you will only need the contestId, this can be a gym contest or a codeforces managed contest. But we do not recommend unfreezing divisional contests as they might be too much data for the API and get a timeout.

#### Private Contests

To use this feature, toggle the Private contest switch, then the app will require the groupID, an API Key and API Secret of a **manager** user of the **private group** you want to access.
We know this is sensible data, so these keys are only used on this react app as a client (they only live in your browser), and they are only sent to codeforces via their API.
You can verify this on the [implementation](./src/parsers/codeforces/codeforces-api-parser.js).

#### IMPORTANT

- The user which provides the API Key and the API Secret needs to be manager of the contest in order to query the Status of the contest.
- Also, due to the design of the API, **the status do not provide unfrozen standings**, so it will be necessary to unfroze the standing for a bit when loading the resolver, and then they can be frozen again.

### vJudge

Currently, vJudge does not provide a public API but it does have an API for its own frontend which can be accessed by foreign applications.

#### Public contests

To unfreeze the public contests just use the contestId, and Saris will prepare the standing.
Note that currently vJudge do not froze standings, so you might only want to use Saris with vJudge when revealing prizes.

#### Private contests

Unfortunately vJudge API does not provide an authentication method, it requires of the user _cookies_ in order to provide a response for **private contests**. We cannot integrate a foreign cookie in our requests as that would be a violation almost all browsers security policies. But a local client (node) which is not ran within a browser, can use the cookie to request the API.

To do this, please:

1. Download the repo as `git clone https://github.com/equetzal/neoSaris`
2. Make sure to be logged in vJudge, and to be manager of the private contest you want to unfreeze.
3. Go to the rank page of the contest, press `ctrl + shift + i` to open the page inspector.
4. Open the network tab and reload the page.
5. Look for the last request with the number of the contest which endpoint is `https://vjudge.net/contest/rank/single/`
6. Check the request headers, and copy the `cookie` header.
7. Go to the repository and replace the values for this command:
   ```bash
   node src/parsers/vjudge/vjudge-api-parser-private.js $FROZEN_TIME_MINUTES $CONTEST_ID $NUMBER_OF_PROBLEMS "$COOKIE" $OUTPUT_FILE
   ```
   It's important to notice that the cookie must be a string to work.
8. Open the `$OUTPUT_FILE` you specified, and you'll find the Raw Data required to run Saris.
9. Copy and paste all the content of the Raw Data, on the Saris Raw Data source.
10. Click on `Start Dancing`

### Other OJ

Feel free to add parsers to the [src/parsers](src/parsers/) directory to then be integrated with the React App. Here you can add static parsers (from text to the required JSON format), or API parsers that integrates neeoSaris directly to another online judge.

### Local Installation
